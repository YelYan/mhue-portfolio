# Simple Static Portfolio

I built this static portfolio within 5 hours for all responsive version.
It was challenging for me to build because my partner need it in a short amount of time.

What I learnt?

- react particles package is a such cool package and it is easier to setup and it also supports typescript

- I used framer motion as a resuable component, it was so much to play with framer motion

## Installation

I used npm, you can use yarn or pnpm anything you like.You can check my particles typescipt code in
components/particles folder

Using **npm**

```bash
npm install tsparticles
```

```bash
npm install tsparticles-slim
```
